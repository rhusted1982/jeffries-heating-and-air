            comment: `So it was on a Friday evening around 8:00 pm and my air quit working. I searched Google and started looking for places. I found Jeffries and noticed they had more reviews and all of them had nothing but good to say. So I called him and decided to have him come on out. He was there very quickly. And had found the problem in no time. It took him no time to fix it. He was very knowledgeable about his job.  Since I no nothing about it I thought I'd ask him questions about my unit and furnace and was more than glad to answer me. He was very affordable. And was very nice. I'm glad to have met him bc he will be my go to guy from now on. I would highly recommend Jeffries you will not regret it.`
